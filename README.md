# 1. Warm Up!
    1.1 "Fork" this repository. 
    1.2 Clone your branch of this repository.

# 2. Input
    2.1 Read input from user into variable "num".
    2.2 Create input validation. Program will continue only if value of num is between <1;1000>.

# 3. Main cycle
    3.1 Remember you need to change actuall value of "num" varaible!
    If actuall value of num variable is even you will need to set new value to result of division num / 2.
    But if value of num is odd set new value to num * 3 + 1.
    3.2 Don't forget to print numbers on screen.

# 4. Test your code
    Example:
    Input: 22
    Output: 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1

    Input: 19
    Output: 58 29 88 44 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1

# 5. Modification
    *5.1* Change your program to print count of main cycle iterations.
    *5.2* Change your program to print count of main cycle iterations for numbers from 100 to 200 without interaction with user.
# 6. Push!
    Don't forget to push your work on your git repository.
